# **About Dashlets**

In Agile CRM, dashboard plays a very vital role. Dashboards are where users track all relevant information. Dashboards consist of small information components called dashlets. Dashboard can have multiple dashlets each showing relevant snapshot information. A dashlet is a summary component that shows snapshot of information like contacts list, pending deals, events, leaderboard and so on. A dashlet may or may not have an equivalent page component.
